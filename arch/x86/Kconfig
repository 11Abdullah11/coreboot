config ARCH_X86
	boolean
	help
	  This option is used to set the architecture of a mainboard.
	  It is usually set in mainboard/*/Kconfig.

config ARCH
	string
	default x86
	depends ARCH_X86
	help
	  This is the name of the respective subdirectory in arch/.

config CPU_I586
	boolean
	help
	  CPU type. At the moment this option selects the reset vector and
	  Cache-as-RAM (CAR) implementation for a mainboard. See
	  arch/x86/Makefile for more hints on possible values.
	  It is usually set in mainboard/*/Kconfig.

config CPU_AMD_GEODELX
	boolean
	help
	  CPU type. At the moment this option selects the reset vector and
	  Cache-as-RAM (CAR) implementation for a mainboard. See
	  arch/x86/Makefile for more hints on possible values.
	  It is usually set in mainboard/*/Kconfig.

config CPU_AMD_K8
	boolean
	help
	  CPU type. At the moment this option selects the reset vector and

config OPTION_TABLE
	boolean
	help
	  This option is used to determine whether the mainboard has

config SMP
	boolean
	help
	  This option is used to enable certain functions to make 
	  coreboot work correctly on symmetric multi processor
	  systems.
	  It is usually set in mainboard/*/Kconfig.
