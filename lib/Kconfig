config COMPRESSION_LZMA
	boolean "Support LZMA compression"
	default y
	help
	  This is the preferred compression method, as LZMA reaches
	  very good compression rates with a small memory footprint.

config COMPRESSION_NRV2B
	boolean "Support NRV2B compression"
	help
	  This compression method has a smaller memory footprint than
	  LZMA but also significantly worse compression results.
