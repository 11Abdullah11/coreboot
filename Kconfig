	bool "Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/mainboards"
	help
	  Enable this option if you want to test development features or
	  incomplete/unsupported mainboards.

	  We do not make any guarantees about anything that is marked
	  as EXPERIMENTAL! You have been warned!

config EXPERT
	bool "Expert mode"
	help
	  This allows you to select certain advanced configuration options.
	  It is mainly intended for LinuxBIOS developers.

	  doing! You have been warned!

config PAYLOAD_ELF
	bool "An ELF executable payload file"
	help
	  Select this option if you have a payload image (an ELF file)
	  which LinuxBIOS should run as soon as the basic hardware
	  initialization is completed.

	  You will be able to specify the location and file name of the
	  payload image later.

config PAYLOAD_NONE
	bool "No payload"
	help
	  Select this option if you want to create an "empty" LinuxBIOS
	  ROM image for a certain mainboard, i.e. a LinuxBIOS ROM image
	  which does not yet contain a payload.

	  For such an image to be useful, you have to use the 'lar' tool
	  to add a payload to the ROM image later.

endchoice

config PAYLOAD_FILE
	string "Payload path and filename"
	depends PAYLOAD_ELF
	default "payload.elf"
	help
	  The path and filename of the ELF executable file to use as payload.
